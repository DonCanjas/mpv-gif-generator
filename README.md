Original script created by [Ruin0x11](https://github.com/Ruin0x11),which you can find [here](https://gist.github.com/Ruin0x11/8fae0a9341b41015935f76f913b28d2a).
This is a port of his gif generator script for Windows.

# Requirements 
- Windows
- mpv
- ffmpeg
 
# Installation
You need to add mpv's (or ffmpeg's) directory to the Windows Path Variable. For help, you can refer to the [comment here](https://github.com/Scheliux/mpv-gif-generator/issues/1#issuecomment-401204625).

Place the lua file into the scripts folder in your mpv's directory. (If there is none, you need to create it.)
